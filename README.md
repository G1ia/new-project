# New Project

This repository is intended for the development of a new project. Here are the instructions on how to create a development branch and work on new features.

## Creating a New Repository

1. Go to the GitHub homepage and log in to your account if you haven't already.
2. Click on the "New" button in the top right corner of the screen to start creating a new repository.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Enter the name of your repository, for example, "new-project".

   - Choose the "Public" or "Private" option, depending on your preference.
   - Leave the other settings as default or customize them as desired.
4. Click on the "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page.

After creating the repository, you will have access to its settings. Now, we will add a second branch for developing new features.
